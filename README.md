# WebsiteReplicator

The WebsiteReplicator Workflow automates the process of replicating a website by analyzing its technology stack using builtwith.com API. First, it retrieves the technology stack information of the target website, then it generates an initial replica skeleton of the website using the acquired data, and finally tests the replica to ensure it was created correctly.
## Initial generation prompt
