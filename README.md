# Component Name

WebsiteReplicator

# Description

WebsiteReplicator is a Yeager component designed to replicate a target website and provide a URL to access the replica, along with the replication status. WebsiteReplicator is a subclass of the AbstractWorkflow and overrides the transform() method to implement its functionality.

# Input and Output Models

- **WebsiteReplicatorIn**: It is a Pydantic BaseModel, which has the following field:
  - `target_website: str` - The URL of the website to be replicated.

- **WebsiteReplicatorOut**: It is a Pydantic BaseModel, which has the following fields:
  - `replica_url: str` - The URL where the replicated website can be accessed.
  - `replica_status: str` - The status of the replication process.

Both input and output models are validated and serialized using Pydantic.

# Parameters

The WebsiteReplicator component does not have any specific parameters outside of the Pydantic BaseModels for input and output.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method processes the input data and returns the output data as follows:
1. Call the `super().transform()` method with the given input arguments and callbacks.
2. Perform the website replication process (**to be implemented**).
3. Generate the `replica_url` and `replica_status` based on the replication process (**to be replaced with actual values**).
4. Create an instance of the `WebsiteReplicatorOut` BaseModel with the generated `replica_url` and `replica_status`.
5. Return the `WebsiteReplicatorOut` instance as output.

# External Dependencies

The component has the following external dependencies:

- `dotenv`: Load environment variables from a .env file.
- `fastapi`: Build the web application to handle input and output.
- `pydantic`: Create, validate and serialize input and output models.

# API Calls

The component does not use any external API calls in the provided implementation. However, the actual website replication process may involve making API calls or fetching resources from the target website.

# Error Handling

The component currently does not have custom error handling implemented. Any errors raised during the processing will propagate up to the caller. Future implementation of the website replication process should consider handling specific exceptions and providing meaningful error messages.
