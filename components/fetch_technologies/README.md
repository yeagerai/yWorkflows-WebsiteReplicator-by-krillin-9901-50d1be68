# FetchTechnologies Component

## Component Name
FetchTechnologies

## Description
The FetchTechnologies component is a building block in a Yeager Workflow designed to obtain a list of technologies used by a specified target website. This component calls the external `builtwith` library to extract the technologies and returns them in a standardized output.

## Input and Output Models
### Input: `FetchTechnologiesInputDict`
- `target_website` (str): The URL of the website to be analyzed for used technologies.

### Output: `FetchTechnologiesOutputDict`
- `technologies` (List[str]): The list of technologies extracted from the target website.

These input and output models make use of the Pydantic library for validation and serialization.

## Parameters
### `api_key` (Optional[str]):
The API key to access the `builtwith` library. The value is loaded from the component's environment variables. This parameter is stored as an attribute of the `FetchTechnologies` class.

## Transform Function
The `transform()` method follows these steps:
1. Set the `builtwith.api_key` attribute to the component's `api_key`.
2. Print a message on the console indicating the execution of the transform method in the FetchTechnologies component.
3. Call the `builtwith.parse()` function with the provided `args.target_website`, and store the parsed response.
4. Extract the 'technologies' list from the parsed response.
5. Create an output dict containing the `technologies` list using the `FetchTechnologiesOutputDict` model.
6. Return the output dict.

## External Dependencies
- The `builtwith` library is used for parsing the input website and extracting the technologies information.
- The `pydantic` library is used for data validation, serialization, and defining the input and output models.
- The `fastapi` library is used for creating a web interface for the component's functionality.

## API Calls
The component makes a call to the `builtwith.parse()` function, passing the `target_website` as an argument. The purpose of this API call is to retrieve information about the technologies used on the specified website.

## Error Handling
This component does not explicitly handle errors or exceptions. However, any exceptions or errors thrown by the external libraries (`builtwith`, `pydantic`, etc.) will be propagated.

## Examples
To use this component within a Yeager Workflow, you will need to supply the required API Key and instantiate the FetchTechnologies object before calling its transform method with the appropriate input.
