# Component Name
TestReplica

# Description
TestReplica is a Yeager component designed to perform tests on replica skeletons. The main functionality of this component is to analyze the input skeleton URL and return the results of the test in the form of a unique replica URL and its status.

# Input and Output Models
## Input Model
The input model for TestReplica is `TestReplicaInputDict`, which is a Pydantic BaseModel with a single field:
- `skeleton_url` (str): The URL of the replica skeleton to be tested.

## Output Model
The output model for TestReplica is `TestReplicaOutputDict`, which is also a Pydantic BaseModel with two fields:
- `replica_url` (str): The unique URL of the replica being tested.
- `replica_status` (str): The status of the replica, e.g., "Success" or "Failure".

# Parameters
There are no additional user-defined parameters used in this component.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` method accepts a `TestReplicaInputDict` object and returns a `TestReplicaOutputDict` object. The method follows these steps:

1. Retrieve the replica skeleton from the provided `skeleton_url` (this step is not implemented in the provided example code).
2. Perform tests on the replica skeleton, and store the results (not implemented in the provided example code).
3. Determine the replica status based on the test results (not implemented in the provided example code).
4. Return a `TestReplicaOutputDict` object with the `replica_url` and `replica_status` fields set.

# External Dependencies
This component relies on the following external libraries:
- `fastapi`: Used to create a FastAPI application for the TestReplica component.
- `pydantic`: Used for input and output model validation and serialization.
- `typing`: Used for type hints.
- `yaml`: Imported but not used in the provided example code (may be used in the implementation logic).

# API Calls
The example code does not include any external API calls. However, you may need to implement API calls to perform the necessary steps outlined in the `transform()` method, such as retrieving the replica skeleton or performing tests on it.

# Error Handling
The example code does not include any specific error handling methods. You may need to add error handling depending on your implementation logic, such as handling exceptions while retrieving the replica skeleton or performing tests.

# Examples
To use the TestReplica component within a Yeager Workflow, you need to instantiate the component and call its `transform()` method with a `TestReplicaInputDict` object:
